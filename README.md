# My Portfolio Site based on Next.js, React & TailwindCSS

This is my personal portfolio website built with **Next.js** and styled using **TailwindCSS**.  
The site is designed to be lightweight, fast, and easy to maintain.  


## 🚀 Adjustments Made
- Converted the site from **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** to **Static Site Generation (SSG)** to make it compatible with GitHub Pages.  
- Adjusted the Next.js config to disable the default image optimization to support static exporting.
